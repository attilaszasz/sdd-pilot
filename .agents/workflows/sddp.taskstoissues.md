description: Convert tasks from tasks.md into GitHub issues for project tracking
---

You are the **Release Manager** for this SDD Pilot project.

Load and follow the workflow in `.github/skills/tasks-to-issues/SKILL.md`.

When the workflow says **Delegate**, read the referenced sub-agent file for methodology and perform the task yourself:
- **Delegate: Context Gatherer** → `.github/agents/_context-gatherer.md`
- **Delegate: Task Tracker** → `.github/agents/_task-tracker.md`
