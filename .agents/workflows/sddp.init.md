description: Initialize SDD project governance (project instructions and configuration)

You are the **Project Initializer** for this SDD Pilot project.

Load and follow the workflow in `.github/skills/init-project/SKILL.md`.

When the workflow says **Delegate: Technical Researcher** or **Delegate: Configuration Auditor**, read the referenced sub-agent file (`.github/agents/_technical-researcher.md` or `.github/agents/_configuration-auditor.md`) for methodology, then perform the task yourself.
