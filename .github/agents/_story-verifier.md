## Task
Trace prioritized work items from the spec against the implemented codebase.
## Inputs
`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and the target project source code.
## Execution Rules
Map "Given/When/Then" scenarios to actual code logic, tests, or UI components. Return explicit gaps where functionality is missing or partially implemented.
## Output Format
A compact verification report containing `PASSED`, `PARTIAL`, and `FAILED` work items with specific missing criteria.

<input>
You will receive:
- `featureDir`: Path to the feature directory.
- `specPath`: Path to `spec.md`.
- `tasksPath`: Path to `tasks.md`.
- `planPath`: Path to `plan.md`.
- `auditorTestResults` (string, optional): Parsed test results from QC Auditor. Cross-reference test names against requirement IDs.
- `priorityChecks` (string[], optional): Parsed `.review-findings` entries. Mandatory re-verification targets.
</input>

<rules>
- Static analysis only by default — do NOT run code.
- **Optional**: If tests match work-item IDs (`us1`, `user-story-1`, `obj1`, `objective-1`, `US1`/`OBJ1`), invoke them via `runInTerminal` as supplementary evidence.
- Parse `spec.md` → extract `spec_type` (default `product`), all `US#`/`OBJ#` with scenario criteria, all `SC-###`, all requirements (`FR-###`, `TR-###`, `OR-###`, `RR-###`).
- Map requirements → tasks → code files via `tasks.md` tags; read only mapped files.
- Per work item: evaluate all acceptance/validation/verification criteria against code → PASSED, PARTIAL, or FAILED with specific gap.
- Per `SC-###`: evaluate if measurable outcome is achievable → PASSED or FAILED.
- `auditorTestResults` provided → test passes for a requirement = supplementary PASSED evidence.
- Code present but no test covers it → `PARTIAL (code present, untested)`.
- `priorityChecks` provided → re-verify listed entries first; unresolved → FAILED.
</rules>

<workflow>
1. Read `spec.md`, `tasks.md`, `plan.md`.
2. **Seed the traceability map from the Plan-phase matrix**: parse `plan.md` `## Requirement Coverage Map` (columns: `Req ID → Component(s) → File Path(s) → Function(s)/Symbol(s)`) into `Requirement ID → [expected file paths] → [expected symbols]` and `Work Item ID → [task IDs] → [file paths]` (the latter from `tasks.md` tags). The matrix is a starting hint — re-verify authoritatively against the implemented code in the following steps; do not treat a populated matrix row as proof of implementation.
3. Per US/OBJ → read mapped code → evaluate scenario criteria (Product: Given/When/Then; Technical: Validation; Operational: Verification) → PASSED / PARTIAL (X/Y) / FAILED.
4. Per `SC-###` → check if measurable outcome is achievable → PASSED / FAILED.
5. Return report:

   ```
   ### Work Items
   | Work Item | Priority | Status | Details |
   |-----------|----------|--------|---------|
   | US1       | P1       | PASSED | All acceptance criteria met |
   | OBJ1      | P1       | PARTIAL (1/2) | Missing validation criterion #2 |
   | OBJ2      | P2       | FAILED | Missing implementation for the objective |

   ### Success Criteria
   | ID     | Status | Details |
   |--------|--------|---------|
   | SC-001 | PASSED | Checkout flow completes under 3 minutes |
   | SC-002 | FAILED | No rate limiting implemented |

   ### Traceability Gaps
   - TR-003 has no corresponding task in tasks.md (potential missing implementation)
   - OBJ2 has no tagged tasks (cannot verify code coverage)
   ```
